How to play:
	1. Open project03.html
	2. Jump to the login page by clicking at the link then sign in, if you don't already have an account, just sign up.
	3. Have fun.

P.S. If you find the sentence displayed boring, you can click the link on the page to add something interesting by yourself.

Notes on how to run the server:
	Note that this game is almost fully based on the server, therefore you have to run the server first.
	1. Under Project03/, run:source bin/activate
	2. cd in the django_project folder, then run:python3 manage.py runserver localhost:10058
	
Features:
	Customize: Add interesting sentences&phrases by yourself!
	Fully Random: We will pick the sentence and phrase randomly from the database. Keep refreshing the page for more fun!
	Collectivity: You will be able to see the contributions from anyone possible, and your ideas also have the opportunity of being displayed on a stranger's screen! 
	Voice(on progress): It's a pity that I didn't make it before the deadline of the project, to be honest it's harder than I have thought. But this feature seems to be really funny therefore I will keep trying.  

Hope you enjoy this simple game!
